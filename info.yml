    defer_keyword:
        type: str
        default_value: ""
        description: "Advanced parameter. This allows for advanced customization around deferred folder creation. 
                      Deferred folder creation allows for the creation of partial subfolder structures depending
                      on a specific keyword (see main documentation for details). Before an app is launched, folders
                      are automatically created and by default (e.g. if you leave this setting as null), 
                      the launch app will pass the name of the engine as the deferred folder creation keyword. 
                      This makes it easy to set up deferred rules in your folder creation config for tk-maya, 
                      tk-nuke etc. However, if you for example wanted to set up specific deferred folder structures 
                      for Nuke and Nuke X (both running the nuke engine), you need a finer granularity. This setting
                      can then be used to override the default behaviour of just passing the engine name. Instead, you
                      can pass any string into the deferred folder creation (for example 'nuke' and 'nuke_x' in the case
                      above). This parameter is also useful if you want to use deferred folder creation in 
                      conjunction with launching of apps which do not have a toolkit engine defined - for these 
                      app launch instances, the engine setting is left blank, and therefore no engine name is passed
                      into the deferred folder creation. In such cases you can utilize this parameter to control
                      the deferred folder creation. 

                      You can specify multiple keywords using a comma as a delimiter (eg. 'nuke, nuke_x').
                      This will trigger folder creation for folders in your schema that have any
                      of these values in their deferred folder creation setting."

                     in the values for the other settings for the instance of this app.  For
                     example, a value of ['2012', '2013', '2014'] for this setting and a value of
                     'Launch Maya {version}' for menu_name would result in the following command
                     menu names being registered: Launch Maya 2012, Launch Maya 2013, Launch
                     Maya 2014.  The first version in the list will be considered the 'default'
                     version if the engine running the app supports the concept. You can use pieces
                     of the version if you wrap the parts in parenthesis like ['(7.0)v3', '(8.0)v1'].
                     These pieces of the version string are available in the other settings via the
                     {v0}, {v1}, {v2}, ... replacement tokens."

    skip_engine_instances:

        description: "A list of string names of engine instances to skip registering Software
                     launcher commands for. For example, a value of ['tk-nukestudio'] for this
                     setting would stop any Software entity launcher commands being registered
                     with the engine that reference the 'tk-nukestudio' engine instance in that
                     environment. This can be used to allow for an engine instance to be configured
                     for a given environment without a launcher existing for it. This is useful
                     in the case of Nuke Studio, where we want to allow for context changes into
                     certain environments, but we only want the application to be launchable from
                     a project environment. This setting only has an impact on Software entity
                     launchers."

                     but merely want to modify the environment before app launch. You may want
                     to add additional pipeline paths, APIs or other things to the setup, or 
                     specify additional scripts etc to run."
