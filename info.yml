configuration:

    menu_name:
        type: str
        description: Name to appear on the Shotgun menu.

    icon:
      type: str
      description: "The path to the icon to appear for the application.  If the
                   value starts with '{target_engine}' then the remainder of the
                   path will be relative to the root of the engine's install.  If
                   the value starts with '{config_path}' then the remainder of the
                   path will be relative to the root of the configuration.  The
                   path should use forward slashes which will be replaced with
                   the correct operating system separator when used."
      default_value: "{target_engine}/icon_256.png"

    # Path information for multiple platforms
    windows_path:
        type: str
        description: The path to the application executable on Windows.
    windows_args:
        type: str
        description: The arguments to be passed to application on Windows, as a string.
        default_value: ""
    linux_path:
        type: str
        description: The path to the application executable on Linux.
    linux_args:
        type: str
        description: The arguments to be passed to application on Linux, as a string.
        default_value: ""
    mac_path:
        type: str
        description: The path to the application executable on Mac OS X.
    mac_args:
        type: str
        description: The arguments to be passed to application on Mac OS X, as a string.
        default_value: ""
    engine:
        type: str
        description: "The name of the Shotgun engine to start. This is typically the application
                      name prefixed with tk, e.g. tk-maya, tk-nuke, tk-photoshop etc. If you set 
                      this to an empty string, no toolkit engine will be started, meaning that 
                      you can launch applications that do not have toolkit engines set up."

    versions:
        type: list
        allows_empty: True
        values:
            type: str
        default_value: []
        description: "A list of strings that will be used to substitute for the {version} token
                     in the values for the other settings for the instance of this app.  For
                     example, a value of [2012, 2013, 2014] for this setting and a value of
                     'Launch Maya {version}' for menu_name would result in the following command
                     menu names being registered: Launch Maya 2012, Launch Maya 2013, Launch
                     Maya 2014.  The first version in the list will be considered the 'default'
                     version if the engine running the app supports the concept."

    extra:
        type: dict
        description: "Shotgun engine specific extra values. These are defined per Shotgun engine.
                     Please look in the app documentation for more details."

    hook_app_launch:
        type: hook
        default_value: app_launch
        description: "Called to launch the application. This hook contains the code that does
                     the actual execution of the launch command and parameters. If you have 
                     a custom launcher system in your studio, it can be handy to override 
                     Tank's default launch behaviour."

    hook_before_app_launch:
        type: hook
        default_value: before_app_launch
        description: "This hook is called just before the hook_app_launch is used and can be
                     useful if you don't want to modify the way applications are being launched
                     (which is advanced usage and can be done by overriding the app_launch hook),
                     but merely want to modify the environment before app launch. You may want
                     to add additional pipeline paths, APIs or other things to the setup, or 
                     specify additional scripts etc to run."
