class SoftwareEntityLauncher(BaseLauncher):
    """
    Launches a DCC application based on site Software entity entries.

    The following logic applies to the software entries in Shotgun:

    - If all three path fields for a software entity are set to None,
      the record is considered an "automatic" record and the launch app
      will automatically scan for suitable entries. When automatic mode
      is used, the software icon and software name defined in Shotgun are
      both ignored. The versions field in shotgun can however be used to
      *limit* the software versions returned by the automatic scan.

      The engine field needs to be set for any automatic entry.

      Please note that in the case of this automatic mode, one Software entity
      in Shotgun may result in multiple app commands being registered.

    - If a path (for any os platform) is set, the manual mode kicks in:

      - The icon will be downloaded from shotgun
      - The name defined in Shotgun will be used
      - The paths defined in Shotgun will be used.
        If the path for the current os is blank, the
        software entity will be skipped.
      - You can specify versions in the versions field
        for each version you specify, one launch entry will
        be generated. If you do this, you should also include
        the {version} token in the name field and the path fields
        and toolkit will automatically substitute it for each
        version number. (if you leave versions blank, one launch
        entry will be created and no substitutions will happen).

    - Groups and group defaults will be applied to both the manual
      and automatic entries. If an entry marked as a group default
      ends up registering more than one launch command, the command
      with the highest version number will be marked as the group
      default.
