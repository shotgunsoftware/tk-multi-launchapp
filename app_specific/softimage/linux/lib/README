Build instructions for openssl & sqlite on Linux
================================================

Softimage 2013 on Linux contains a custom version of Python 2.5.2 that does not include ssl
libraries required by the Shotgun api, or the sqlite3 Python library required by Toolkit.

Versions of these libraries are provided as part of the tk-multi-launchapp app.  However, 
if for some reason these do not work for your specific distribution of Linux, the following 
instructions are included detailing how they were built.

Providing alternative libraries on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH & PYTHONPATH prior to launching 
Softimage using tk-multi-launchapp will allow your libraries to be used instead.

These instructions assume a clean Centos 6 linux build.

The main steps to build these libraries are:

1. Build GCC 4.1.2
2. Build openssl v0.9.7m
3. Build sqlite
4. Build Python 2.5.2 to create _sqlite3.so Python library

Note, the steps for building GCC & Python are the same as those required when building Qt and
PySide for Softimage 2013 as detailed in tk-softimage/resources/pyside121_py25_qt485_linux/README.


Build GCC 4.1.2
---------------

Softimage 2013 is built using GCC 4.1.2 so it's important to build everything with the same 
version of the compiler to avoid segmentation errors and other unexpected problems.

Follow these steps to build GCC 4.1.2 and configure your build environment for everything 
else.

1.  Configure the build environment:
    
    a.  You'll need gcc to build gcc! - if you don't have a version of gcc installed then
        install the latest version:
        
        sudo yum install gcc-c++.x86_64
    
    b.  Install the gcc development package:
        
        sudo yum install glibc-devel.x86_64
        sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686
    
    c.  Building gcc also requires the zlib development package:
        
        sudo yum install zlib-devel.x86_64
        
    d.  Install texinfo for doc generation:
    
        sudo yum install texinfo.x86_64

2.  Download & extract:
    
    a.  Download the source from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.1.2 or equivalent
     
    b.  Extract to a directory, e.g.: ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/gcc412/gcc-build - you should 
        end up with the directory: ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/gcc412/gcc-build/gcc-4.1.2

3.  Configure:

    a.  Make sure you are in the correct directory:  
    
        cd ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/gcc412/gcc-build 
        
        Note: It's very important to be in the gcc-build directory and NOT /gcc-4.1.2
        otherwise you will have issues when building gcc!

    b.  Configure gcc using the following command:
    
        ./gcc-4.1.2/configure --prefix=/opt/gcc412 --program-suffix=412 --enable-shared 
        --enable-threads=posix -enable-checking=release --with-system-zlib 
        --disable-libunwind-exceptions --enable-__cxa_atexit 

4.  Build & install:
    
    a.  Build gcc:
    
        make -j4 bootstrap

    When building, you will probably encounter this error:
    
        WARNING: `makeinfo' is missing on your system.  You should only need it if                                                                   
             you modified a `.texi' or `.texinfo' file, or any other file                                                                        
            indirectly affecting the aspect of the manual.  The spurious                                                                        
            call might also be the consequence of using a buggy `make' (AIX,                                                                    
            DU, IRIX).  You might want to install the `Texinfo' package or
            the `GNU make' package.  Grab either from any GNU archive site.
        make[4]: *** [fastjar.info] Error 1
    
    This is a known issue with earlier versions of gcc and can be safely fixed by
    editing the MakeFile (~/xsi_pyside_build/src/gcc412/gcc-build/MakeFile) and changing 
    the line:
    
        MAKEINFO = ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/gcc412/gcc-build/gcc-4.1.2/missing makeinfo
        
    to:
    
        MAKEINFO = makeinfo

    b.  Install gcc: 
    
        sudo make install
        
        Note: This will install into the /opt/gcc412 directory that was specified in the
        configure command.

5.  Setup symlinks:

    Setting up these symlinks will make it easier to compile everything else using this
    specific version of GCC.

        cd /usr/bin
        sudo ln -s /opt/gcc412/bin/gcc412 .
        sudo ln -s /opt/gcc412/bin/g++412 .


Build Openssl 0.9.7m
--------------------

It's important to build this specific version (0.9.7m) for Softimage 2013 to avoid unexpected
problems. 

1.  Configure the build environment:

    a.  Install the openssl development package:
    
        sudo yum install openssl-devel.x86_64 

2.  Download & extract:

    a.  Download the source from http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.7m.tar.gz.
    
    b.  Extract to the directory ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/openssl097m

3.  Configure:

    a.  Unfortunately, this version of openssl doesn't respect the CC $ CXX environment variables
        used to define the version of the compiler to use!  Therefore, it is necessary to either:
        
        i.  Modify ~/xsi_pyside_build/openssl097m/Configure and replace gcc with gcc412 for your
            specific target.  To find the target, run ./config as detailed below - the target is
            specified on the second line of the output, e.g.:
            
                ...
                Configuring for linux-x86_64
                ...
                
            Now search for the target and replace gcc with gcc412.  For example, using the target
            'linux-x86_64' from above, you would replace:
            
                "linux-x86_64", "gcc:-m64 -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIO...
            
            with:
            
                "linux-x86_64", "gcc412:-m64 -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIO...

        ii. Temporarily remap the symlinks for gcc & g++ in /usr/bin to /opt/gcc412/bin/gcc412 and 
            /opt/gcc412/bin/g++412 respectively (remember to change them back after building openssl)

    b.  Make sure you are in the correct directory:
    
        cd ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/openssl097m
        
    c.  Configure using the following command:
    
        ./config --prefix=$HOME/xsi_pyside_build/openssl097m shared

4.  Build  & install:

    a.  Build openssl
    
        make -j4
        
    b.  Install openssl:
    
        make install
        
        Note: This will install into the ~/xsi_pyside_build/openssl097m directory that was specified 
        in the configure command.
        
5.  Copy dso's
        
    You should now place the following files on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH prior to launching Softimage
    renaming them as required: 
        
        libssl.so.0.9.7     => libssl.so.4
        libcrypto.so.0.9.7  => libcrypto.so.4 


Build sqlite3
-------------

1.  Configure the build environment:

    a.  Again, we need to use our specific version of GCC so set the following environment variables
        to control this: 

        export CC=gcc412
        export CXX=g++412
    
2.  Download & extract:
    
    a.  Download the source from http://www.sqlite.org or equivelant - the latest version should
        be fine but if in doubt, the version used here was downloaded from:
        http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-3070900.tar.gz
    
    b.  Extract to the directory ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/sqlite
    
3.  Configure:

    a.  Make sure you are in the correct directory:
    
        cd ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/sqlite
        
    b.  Configure using the following command:
    
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/xsi_pyside_build/py252

4.  Build  & install:

    a.  Build sqlite
    
        make -j4
        
    b.  Install sqlite:
    
        make install
        
        Note: This will install into the ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252 directory that was specified 
        in the configure command.


Build Python 2.5.2 to create _sqlite3.so Python library
-------------------------------------------------------

Softimage 2013 includes a custom version of Python 2.5.2 which can't be run externally from
Softimage.  Because we need an install of Python to build PySide, this means we need to build
a version that's as close to the one bundled with Softimage as we can!

Follow these steps to build Python 2.5.2 with GCC 4.1.2.

1.  Configure the build environment:

    a.  Again, make sure the following environment variables are set to use our specific 
        version of GCC: 

        export CC=gcc412
        export CXX=g++412
        
    b.  Install the python development package:
    
        sudo yum install python-devel.x86_64
    
2.  Download & extract:
    
    a.  Download the source from http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.1.2 or equivelant
    
    b.  Extract to the directory ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/py252
    
3.  Configure:

    a.  Make sure you are in the correct directory:
    
        cd ~/xsi_pyside_build/src/py252
        
    b.  Configure using the following command:
    
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/xsi_pyside_build/py252 --enable-shared --enable-unicode=ucs4
    
4.  Build  & install:

    a.  Build Python 2.5.2
    
        make -j4
        
    b.  Install Python 2.5.2:
    
        make install
        
        Note: This will install into the ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252 directory that was specified 
        in the configure command.

5.  Test
    
    Python 2.5.2 should now have been installed to ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252.  This doesn't replace
    your system python!  To test, add ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and then
    run python from within ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252/bin, e.g.:
        
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/xsi_pyside_build/py252/lib
        cd ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252/bin
        ./python
    
    To test that sqlite has been built properly, run the following in your python shell:
    
        import sqlite3
    
    You shouldn't see any errors.

6.  Copy _sqlite3.so

    The _sqlite3.so required by Toolkit can be found in ~/xsi_pyside_build/py252/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload
    and should be placed on your PYTHONPATH prior to launching Softimage.
